3. Prove that the signature of an Enigma configuration is independent of the plugboard. (I.e., argue that
the signature of a particular rotor sequence/setting is unchanged when you alter plugboard pairings.)

Let P be our signature-finding algorithm, and P(x) be the signature computed from a configuration x. 
We will show that P(x) = P(x')
